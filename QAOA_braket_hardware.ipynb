    "__Combinatorial optimization__: \n",
    "Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous across many areas of science and application areas. \n",
    "Applications can be found (for example) in logistics, scheduling, planning, and portfolio optimization.\n",
    "In a nutshell combinatorial optimization problems are problems involving a large number of yes/no decisions with each set of decisions yielding a corresponding objective function value, like a cost or profit value. \n",
    "Because of the combinatorial explosion of the solution space with the number of variables, finding good solutions is a daunting task and extremely difficult.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__QUBO problems__: The QUBO ([Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization)) model unifies a rich variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: \n",
    "Famous examples include Quadratic Assignment Problems, Capital Budgeting Problems, Task Allocation Problems and Maximum-Cut Problems. \n",
    "For more details we refer to the excellent review and tutorial on QUBO problems presented in Ref.[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "__Maximum Cut__: Among the class of QUBO problems, Maximum Cut (MaxCut) is paradigm combinatorial optimization problem. \n",
    "Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, we seek partition of $V$ into two subsets with maximum cut. \n",
    "In short, we have to color every node either blue or red and we score a point whenever an edge connects two nodes with different colors. \n",
    "We then would like to find the solution with the highest score. \n",
    "Applications thereof can be found in, for example, (i) clustering for marketing purposes (segment your customer base into different clusters for targeted marketing) or (ii) portfolio optimization in finance (vertex corresponds to asset, with color referring to sell or buy decisions. \n",
    "Again, the problem in this specific graph coloring problem is that there are $2^𝑁$ possible solutions for $N$ nodes (an exponential explosion in possibilities), making it impossible to enumerate all possible candidates for relevant system sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Ising Hamiltonian__: Importantly, there is a fundamental correspondence between QUBO problems and Ising problems in physics. \n",
    "Specifically, we can encode the Maximum Cut problem as a __minimization problem__ of an Ising Hamiltonian, where the (classical) cost function reads \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{C}=\\sum_{i>j} J_{i,j} z_{i} z_{j},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with Ising variables $z_{i}=-1,1$ and the Ising matrix $J$ encoding the weights of the edges. \n",
    "For the sake of this discussion, we ignore potential linear terms and constant offsets (that do not affect the optimal solution $z$ anyway). \n",
    "In short, the cost Hamiltonian $H_{C}$ assigns a number to every bitstring $z=(z_{1},z_{2},\\dots)$, and we would like to find the lowest number possible. \n",
    "This will be the optimal assignment and solution to our problem. "

    "In this notebook we will try to solve for the optimal _classical_ bitstring $z$ using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). \n",
    "To this end, we first promote the classical spin variables $z_{i}=-1,1$ to quantum-mechanical variables $\\sigma_{i}^{z}$ (with the Pauli matrix $\\sigma_{i}^{z}$ representing the observable corresponding to spin along the $z$ coordinate axis in three-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$). \n",
    "This leads to the following quantum mechanical cost Hamiltonian encoding the optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{C}=\\sum_{i>j} J_{i,j} \\sigma_{i}^{z} \\sigma_{j}^{z},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be written as a matrix of size $(2^{N}, 2^{N})$ with diagonal elements only corresponding to all possible classical values for the cost function $H_{C}$. \n",
    "The ground state of $\\hat{H}_{C}$ corresponds to the optimal solution of the classical combinatorial problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "__QAOA ansatz__: Finding this ground state is generically hard. \n",
    "To approximate this groundstate, QAOA prepares a parametrized ansatz state (corresponding to a parameterized  gate  sequence),  whose  parameters  are iteratively updated by a classical optimizer in a closed loop. \n",
    "Specifically, QAOA involves a specific ansatz wavefunction parametrized by a parameter family $(\\vec{\\beta}, \\vec{\\gamma})$, embedded into a larger classical optimization loop to find the optimal values for these parameters. \n",
    "Approximate solutions to the problem class considered here can be found by preparing the variational state \n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\gamma, \\beta \\rangle = U_{x}(\\beta_{p})U_{zz}(\\gamma_{p}) \\cdots U_{x}(\\beta_{1})U_{zz}(\\gamma_{1}) |s\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with single qubit rotations induced by $U_{x}(\\beta) = \\exp(-i\\beta \\sum_{i}\\sigma_{i}^{x})$, \n",
    "and interactions described by $U_{zz}(\\gamma) = \\exp(-i\\gamma H_{C})$,\n",
    "starting initially from a product of $\\sigma^{x}$ eigenstates, i.e.,\n",
    "$|s\\rangle =|-,-,\\dots\\rangle$, with $|-\\rangle = (|0\\rangle -|1\\rangle  )/\\sqrt{2}$. \n",
    "The family of states $|\\gamma, \\beta \\rangle$ is prepared by alternating single-qubit operations $U_{x}(\\beta_{p})$ with targeted spin-spin interactions generated by the cost Hamiltonian $H_{C}$. \n",
    "The depth $p$ can be interpreted as a hyperparameter. \n",
    "For $p$ layers of QAOA blocks, there are $2p$ classical parameters to optimize over, \n",
    "since each layer $k$ is characterized by just two variational parameters, $\\gamma_{k}$ and $\\beta_{k}$. \n",
    "The preparation step outlined above is followed by a measurement in the computational basis, giving a classical string $z$, with which one can evaluate the objective function $H_{C}$ of the underlying combinatorial problem at hand. \n",
    "Taking several measurements shots one can build the expectation value $E(\\beta, \\gamma) = \\langle H_{C} \\rangle$ that we report as the objective function to the classical minimizer (while other choices could be possible as well). \n",
    "Repeating this procedure will provide an optimized string $z$, with the quality of the result improving as the depth of the quantum circuit $\\sim 2p$ is increased. \n",
    "In fact, in principle (in the absence of noise and other imperfections), QAOA can reach the global optimum of any cost function in the limit $p \\rightarrow \\infty$, approaching the adiabatic protocol. \n",
    "Thus, in theory the computational power of QAOA increases with $p$, but in practice the number of layers that can be executed without errors on NISQ devices is limited due noise and imperfections. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Optimization__: Since we are primarily interested in solving the classical optimization problem, within this routine it is sufficient to keep track of the best classical bitstring. \n",
    "This means that the wavefunction prepared by the quantum circuit $|\\gamma, \\beta \\rangle$ has to have some overlap with the optimal solution $|z^{*} \\rangle$ that we can read out as bitstring $z^{*}$ in the measurement shots. \n",
    "To this end, in principle (i.e., without any training), we could just sample from a completely uniform state that is prepared in a superposition of all computational basis states, as prepared by applying Hadamard gates to all qubits: $|\\mathrm{uniform}\\rangle = 1/\\sqrt{2^{N}}\\sum_{i}|z_{i}\\rangle$. \n",
    "In that case (assuming a single optimal solution) the success probability per shot amounts to $p_{\\mathrm{success}}=1/2^{N}$. \n",
    "We can then amplify our success chances by just taking many measurement shots. \n",
    "For large systems, however, this approach is not scalable as we would need to take an exponentially increasing number of measurements. \n",
    "That is why we train our circuits, update the parameters, with the goal to increase our success chances to find the optimal bitstring. \n",
    "We can quantify our success chances as follows. \n",
    "For a given wavefunction $|\\gamma, \\beta \\rangle$ the probability to find the optimal solution in a single shot is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{\\mathrm{success}}(\\gamma, \\beta) = |\\langle z^{*}|\\gamma, \\beta \\rangle |^{2},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z^{*}$ denotes the optimal bitstring. \n",
    "If we perform $M$ repeated measurements, the overall probability $P$ for observing this solution at least once is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = 1 - (1-p_{\\mathrm{success}}(\\gamma, \\beta))^{M}, $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "since the term $(1-p_{\\mathrm{success}}(\\gamma, \\beta))^{M}$ gives the probability of _not_ obtaining $z^{*}$ in repeated $M$ trials. \n",
    "Therefore, to have an overall success chance up to $\\epsilon$ close to 100%, i.e., $P \\geq 1-\\epsilon$, the number of required shots has to be \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M \\geq \\frac{\\log(\\epsilon)}{\\log(1-p_{\\mathrm{success}}(\\gamma, \\beta))}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us illustrate this results as follows: \n",
    "If we do not know anything and just resort to a uniform superposition $|\\mathrm{uniform}\\rangle$, for a small system with $N=10$ qubits we can find the optimal solutions with 80% success probability by taking at least $\\sim 1650$ shots. \n",
    "For just $N=20$ qubits, however, this number amounts to $\\sim 1.7 \\times 10^{6}$, making this naive approach unfeasible. \n",
    "Conversely, if we can train the quantum circuit to obtain $p_{\\mathrm{success}}(\\gamma, \\beta) \\sim 0.1$, we only need $\\sim 15$ shots to have $P\\geq 80\\%$. \n",
    "Below we will track and illustrate the best classical optimum as our algorithm proceeds towards a local or (ideally) global optimum.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Objective function__: Finally, the quality of our solution will be assessed via the approximation ratio $r^{*}$ defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r^{*} = \\frac{\\text{Minimum energy calculated by QAOA}}{\\text{True minimum eigenvalue of the cost Hamiltonian}} $$\n"

    "We are now all set to run some QAOA simulation experiments. \n",
    "First of all, you can play and experiment yourself with the number of qubits $N$. \n",
    "Secondly, you may also experiment with the classical optimizer. \n",
    "Since we are using an off-the-shelf, black-box ```scipy``` minimizer (as described in more detail [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html)), you can simply swap between different optimizers by setting the ```OPT_METHOD``` parameter below. \n",
    "Some popular options readily available within this library include *Nelder-Mead*, *BFGS* and *COBYLA*. \n",
    "As a precautionary warning, note that the classical optimization step may get stuck in a local optimum, rather than finding the global minimum for our parametrized QAOA ansatz wavefunction. \n",
    "To address this issue, we may run several optimization loops, starting from different random parameter seeds. \n",
    "While this brute-force approach does not provide any guarantee to find the global optimum, from a pragmatic point of view at least it does increase the odds of finding an acceptable solution, at the expense of potentially having to run many more circuits on the simulator or QPU, respectively.\n",
    "Finally, the optimization loop may require the execution of many individual quantum tasks (i.e., single circuit executions for fixed parameters). \n",
    "For example, when choosing the classical [Powell](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-powell.html#optimize-minimize-powell) optimizer for the graph considered here, we find $\\sim 270$ cycles in the for loop. \n",
    "For the local simulator device chosen here by default this is not an issue, but if you run this algorithm on any QPU you may want to adjust the ```maxfev``` parameter to control the maximum allowed number function evaluations (compare comment in the next code block below)."
